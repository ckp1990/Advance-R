## explaining data

Var name | Detail
---------|-------
pprim ssite |  Percentage of Primary trees in each sub-site 
pprim ssite |  Percentage of Secondary trees in each sub-site
phss 1km | Percentage of the landscape within  1km  respectively, of each subsite that is highly suitable 
phss 2.5km | Percentage of the landscape within 2.5 KM , respectively, of each subsite that is highly suitable 
phss 5km | Percentage of the landscape within  5km, respectively, of each subsite that is highly suitable 
pm 1km | Percentage of the landscape within  1 KM  respectively, of each subsite that is marginal suitable 
pm 2.5km | Percentage of the landscape within  2.5 KM  respectively, of each subsite that is marginal suitable 
pm 5km | Percentage of the landscape within  5 KM  respectively, of each subsite that is marginal suitable 
pdens 1km | Density (patches/100 ha) of habitat at 1 KM
pdens 2.5km |Density (patches/100 ha) of habitat at 2.5 Km
pdens 5km | Density (patches/100 ha) of habitat
edens 1km | Density (m/ha) of habitat patch edges
edens 2.5km | Density (m/ha) of habitat patch edges
edens 5km | Density (m/ha) of habitat patch edges
rdens 1km | Density (m/ha) of paved roads 
rdens 2.5km | Density (m/ha) of paved roads 
rdens 5km | Density (m/ha) of paved roads 

# Data expolaration and discriptive

The can be two major issue

1. Col linearity and/or
2. Spatial auto correlation. 

## Collinear check 


```{r coll,echo=T}
cor(Koalas[,6:22],method = "spearman")
```

We can see that similar variable at different distance are show co-linear behavior.This suggest that our data is spatial nested.
